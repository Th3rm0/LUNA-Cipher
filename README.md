# LUNA-Cipher

This is the LUNA Cipher. LUNA is an acryonym for Layered Unbreakable Numerical Algorithm. This cipher will be based upon a previous cipher I created named the TESS Cipher. The TESS Cipher (Transformational Enhanced Shift System) used a modified version of the Ceaser Cipher which increases the shift used as it encrypts the message. The LUNA Cipher is based on the same principle, however, at the very end of the encryption, the whole message is put through the Polybius Cipher.
